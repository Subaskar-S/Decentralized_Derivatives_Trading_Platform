# Architecture Overview

## System Components

### 1. Core Smart Contracts

#### DerivativesEngine
- **Purpose**: Main contract for perpetual swap trading
- **Key Features**:
  - Position management (open/close/modify)
  - Funding rate calculations
  - Collateral handling
  - Integration with price oracles

#### RiskManager
- **Purpose**: Risk assessment and liquidation system
- **Key Features**:
  - Margin ratio calculations
  - Liquidation triggers
  - Risk parameter management
  - Position health monitoring

#### PriceOracle
- **Purpose**: Aggregated price feed system
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-oracle integration (Chainlink + Pyth)
  - TWAP calculations
  - Price validation and fallbacks
  - Manipulation resistance

#### Governance
- **Purpose**: DAO-based protocol governance
- **Key Features**:
  - Proposal creation and voting
  - Parameter updates
  - Token-weighted voting
  - IPFS metadata integration

### 2. Oracle Integration

#### Chainlink Integration
- Primary price feeds for major pairs (ETH/USD, BTC/USD)
- High reliability and proven track record
- Decentralized oracle network

#### Pyth Network Integration
- Low-latency price updates
- High-frequency trading support
- Confidence intervals for price data

#### Price Aggregation Strategy
1. Primary: Use Chainlink for stable, reliable prices
2. Secondary: Use Pyth for low-latency updates
3. Fallback: TWAP calculation from historical data
4. Validation: Cross-reference between oracles

### 3. Risk Management

#### Margin System
- **Initial Margin**: Required to open position (e.g., 10%)
- **Maintenance Margin**: Minimum to keep position open (e.g., 6%)
- **Liquidation Threshold**: Automatic position closure trigger

#### Liquidation Process
1. Monitor margin ratios continuously
2. Trigger liquidation when below maintenance margin
3. Incentivize liquidators with fees
4. Protect against bad debt with insurance fund

### 4. Funding Rate Mechanism

#### Calculation
```
Funding Rate = (Mark Price - Index Price) / Index Price * Funding Coefficient
```

#### Implementation
- Calculate every hour
- Apply to all open positions
- Long positions pay when mark > index
- Short positions pay when index > mark

### 5. Scaling Solution

#### Optimism L2 Integration
- Reduced gas costs (10-100x cheaper)
- Faster transaction finality
- Ethereum security guarantees
- Easy bridging to/from mainnet

#### Performance Optimizations
- Batch transaction processing
- Efficient storage patterns
- Gas-optimized contract design
- Calldata compression

### 6. Governance System

#### Proposal Types
1. **Parameter Updates**: Margin ratios, funding intervals
2. **Market Addition**: New trading pairs
3. **Risk Configuration**: Liquidation parameters
4. **Protocol Upgrades**: Contract improvements

#### Voting Mechanism
- Token-weighted voting
- Minimum proposal threshold
- Quorum requirements
- Time-locked execution

### 7. Frontend Architecture

#### React Application
- Modern UI with real-time updates
- Wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Trading interface with charts
- Portfolio management

#### GraphQL Integration
- Historical trade data
- Position tracking
- Real-time subscriptions
- Efficient data fetching

### 8. Data Indexing

#### The Graph Protocol
- Subgraph for trade indexing
- Historical position data
- Funding rate history
- Governance proposal tracking

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- OpenZeppelin security patterns
- Reentrancy protection

- Circuit breakers
- Manipulation detection

### Governance Security
- Time-locked execution
- Multi-sig emergency controls
- Proposal validation
- Vote delegation security

## Deployment Strategy
